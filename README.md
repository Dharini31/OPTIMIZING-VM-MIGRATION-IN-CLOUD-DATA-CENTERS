Optimizing VM Migration in Cloud Data Centers

Project Overview: 
The project focuses on optimizing Virtual Machine (VM) migration in cloud data centers to enhance resource utilization, energy efficiency, and service quality. As cloud environments face dynamic workloads, VMs often need to be migrated between hosts to maintain balance, reduce energy consumption, and minimize costs.
